        <h1>Information on the Project Healm</h1>
        <h4>The Project - Healm</h4>
        <p class="border">
            Our website - "Healm" will allow the user to record their day to day by keeping track of actions and how these actions affect their physical and mental well being over time. 
            Users will be able to create new actions that repeat over some time interval, 
            and over each time interval the user will enter relevant data related to that action. 
            ome data will likely be fixed for any created actions, such as ranking how one feels mentally or physically on a scale of 1-10, and possibly an area for notes that can expand on nuances not able to be expressed through a simple numerical scale. 
            The ability to create custom data fields may be desirable as well. The goal here is to give users a better understanding of how various actions affect their lives on a day to day,
            as well as long term, basis in a more concrete and analytical way.
            Functionality to create groups may be added later, wherein certain actions will be ascribed by the group owner to its
            members, and the effects of these actions can be analyzed by said owner. This may possibly be of utility to those conducting research, 
            or even in a less professional setting like a personal trainer keeping track of how effective their exercise regimen is for their clients.
